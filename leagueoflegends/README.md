Last tested: None

## Abstract
Install League Of Legends on Gentoo that works on platinum.

## Expected
- Install Wine with patches from Andrew Wesie AND/OR Wine Staging for league of legends only.
- Install dependencies from `winetricks` - `corefonts adobeair vcrun2008 vcrun2017 winxp glsl=disabled`
- Install League Of Legends using `wine` 
   - Installing extracted installer breaks the licence
