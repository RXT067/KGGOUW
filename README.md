## KGGOUW [KGáº˜: (tlhlngan accent)]

*Take me down to the workaround city where the ebuilds are wierd and runtime not pretty, but it just fucking works!!*

Krey's Gentoo Gaming Overlay Using Wrapper (RXT067/KGGOUW) as a workaround for non-root invokation of commands of RXT067/KGGO's ebuilds cause of bug #673888 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/673888) that is using RXT067/Scripts/KUWAC and asking for USER variable using `PROPERTIES="interactive"` if needed, because POL4 is not maintained anymore, POL5 is not usable atm (https://github.com/PhoenicisOrg/scripts/pull/797) and lutris sucks since it's issues are not resolved sufficiently (https://github.com/lutris/lutris/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+author%3AKreyren+) while beeing blamed by crazy gay tannisroot for every single shit he can think of.
